#Angular 2 Tutorials Using Webpack

## What is This?
The Angular 2 tutorials from [angular.io](https://angular.io/) utilize
[SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) as the module-packaging method. I'm
a fan of [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for my module-loading so I took the
opportunity to modify the tutorials using Webpack.

###Let's Address _That_ Elephant

The modern environment for developing web applications is not trivial. The JavaScript
community has developed some extermely useful and cool tools to move our ability to
develop forward. It's all for the good. But it can be cumbersome.

So keep it in mind that the process for setting this thing up is not going to be a
matter of a couple of lines of code. But once you have it set up, you'll have (at
least) a base for developing moving forward!
